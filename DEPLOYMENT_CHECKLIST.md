   - Host: wisley.net
   - Path: `/public_html/labfonac/`

2. **Upload Files:**
   ```
   C:\labfonac\* → /public_html/labfonac/*
   ```

3. **Verify Upload:**
   - Check all files transferred successfully
   - Verify file sizes match local build
   - Ensure directory structure preserved

4. **Test on Staging:**
   - Visit: https://wisley.net/labfonac/
   - Test all functionality
   - Check console for errors
   - Verify mobile responsive design

### Option 2: Automated Deployment Script

The former staging deployment script was retired when publication moved to the Editor Labfonac. See the historical notice above for the current documentation.
